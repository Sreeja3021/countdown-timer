Countdown Timer Web Application Documentation
________________________________________
Project Overview
This Countdown Timer Web Application allows users to set a specific date and time in the future and counts down to that moment in real time. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the timer dynamically updates the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the target date is reached. Upon reaching the target time, a completion message is displayed.

o	The remaining time is displayed and updated dynamically in real time.
2.	Validation:
o	Ensures the user selects a valid date and time before starting the countdown.
3.	Completion Notification:
o	Displays a message ("Countdown Complete!") when the countdown reaches zero.
4.	Responsive Design:
o	The layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring usability across devices.
5.	Optional Enhancements (if implemented):

How the Project Works
1.	HTML:
o	The structure includes: 
	A heading for the timer.
	An input field for selecting the target date and time.
	A "Start" button to begin the countdown.
	A display area for showing the remaining time.
2.	CSS:
o	Styles are applied to make the timer visually appealing.
o	Buttons, input fields, and the timer display are customized for a clean and modern look.
3.	JavaScript:
o	When the "Start" button is clicked: 
	The user's input is retrieved.
	The time difference between the current time and the target time is calculated.
	The remaining time is updated every second using the setInterval() function.
o	When the countdown reaches zero: 
	The interval is cleared.
	A message is displayed, and optional effects (like sound or animations) are triggered.
